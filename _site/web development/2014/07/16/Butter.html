    <h2>Butter iOS App</h2>

<h4>Case Study - Empathy Focus</h4>

<h6>Introduction</h6>

<p>Butter is an early stage start-up developing a property management service. Their initial product is a unifying platform for maintenance and personal services related to the home. I helped develop the product vision in a few steps. In this case study, I&#39;ll explain how my design decisions were guided by a focus on user emotions.</p>

<h6>Strategy</h6>

<p>I was encouraged by the team to create an experience that felt aspirational - the tagline is &quot;Every home, better.&quot; However, I knew that users were likely to come to the service with no small degree of stress and anxiety. Property management can be overwhelming, and the product needed to ameliorate those feelings before it could create a &quot;delightful&quot; experience. Justifying this strategy to the team through Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy of Needs, I focused first on making the functionality intuitive and reassuring before adding layers of aspiration and playfulness. </p>

<h6>Information Architecture</h6>

<p>The first project I worked on was a conception of the landlord dashboard on desktop. The primary service Butter offers is &quot;Making it Happen&quot; - responding to events like plumbing issues or viewing requests with proposed solutions. Many of these are time-sensitive and require a landlord response. My key concern was how to make the landlord feel confident and competent about responding to these problems through Butter.</p>

<p>Designers often talk about user frustration, but &quot;user anxiety&quot; is less frequently mentioned. In contrast to frustration, which is directed at the product, anxiety is directed inward. As interface design becomes more anticipatory, we should take more responsibility for preventing the user from doubting their own competence.</p>

<p>Identifying points of user anxiety and doing all you can to prevent them is key to creating an experience that makes a user feel good about themselves. This emotion is a more powerful than feeling well-served by a product.</p>

<p>A user&#39;s primary anxiety would be missing something- failing to react to a situation properly or in time, leading to negative consequences. So I wanted to establish a clear division between items required a response, and items that could be passively viewed. I designed a dashboard with a home page that functioned like a feed with pinned posts. It would be incredibly easy to find and respond to important items. A notification center in the top navigation also presented a visual reminder of unresolved issues. 
My secondary goal was to drive engagement, so I envisioned a feed of various types of stories, including social, news, and updates. Updates would also be visible and organized by date in Accounting, but I wanted to give the user a feeling that things were being continually taken care of, to build their trust in the product. I came up with a few ideas for the types of content that might exist in this feed.
The deliverable for this initial project was a mockup with usability notes - a starting point for what the product should feel like.

</div></p>

<h6>App prototyping</h6>

<p>The next step was taking these ideas, gathering feedback, and designing a native mobile app to evolve the concept of the product. I found that in my initial dashboard conception, it wasn&#39;t always clear where to find information, especially when it was stored in multiple pages. I didn&#39;t like the idea that a landlord might see an update in their newsfeed and try to find it a few days later by scrolling through pages and pages of content. I wanted to create clearer divisions. </p>

<p>I reinvisioned the pinned items as an Inbox. Again, because this area was the most likely source of anxiety, I wanted the interface to be really familiar. I designed it to look like a traditional email inbox, with unresolved items in bold and a notification center counting the number of unresolved messages. The key choice was that, unlike in email where messages are by default marked as read once they&#39;ve been opened, items wouldn&#39;t be unbolded until they were actively marked resolved. This eliminates the possibility of reading a proposal and forgetting to react. After I started using Google Inbox, I realized that they used a similar design pattern where items had to be marked &quot;Done&quot; before they were moved from your Inbox (and you were one step closer to that glorious Inbox Zero). Passive updates would still be viewable here, but it would be clear that they didn&#39;t need an active response.</p>

<h6>Inbox flow</h6>

    <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4"><img class="border" src="/img/portfolio/Butter/Prototype/Scheduled-proposal.png"></div>

</div>

<p>I also mocked up a few other core functions, like upgrade requests, a calendar, and a social board. Using inVision, I created a prototype to clarify some of the interactions. I went with a cleaner design, but the visual design of this prototype was not super deliberate- this was mostly about organization and function. </p>

<h6>Evolving from functional to fun</h6>

<p>This prototype was given to a visual design agency that developed a more distinct visual feel for the app. For my final project, an onboarding flow, I drew on their style. My main goal in the onboarding flow was to maintain a feeling of competence while adding a layer of fun. Especially because the process is very long compared to a standard introduction to an app, it had to be very easy to use and combat feelings of boredom or being overwhelmed. </p>

<h6>Summary</h6>

<p>I&#39;ve always loved Kathleen Windsor&#39;s quote, &quot;Charm is the ability to make someone think that both of you are pretty wonderful.&quot; While a lot of design focuses on creating a product that satisfies the user&#39;s explicit needs, this project pushed me to think about people&#39;s implicit needs- their desire to feel competent, accomplished, and special. More importantly, I had to think about how to prioritize those needs to build an experience that struck a balance between reassuring and entertaining. I really loved working on this project. It&#39;s not in development yet, unfortunately, but I look forward to updating this when the app is live.</p>
