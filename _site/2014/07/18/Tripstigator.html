<h3>Case Study- Brand Focus</h3>

<h6>Introduction</h6>

<p>Tripstigator is a social enterprise that helps people turn their cultural knowledge into income through ecommerce. While the platform is socially minded, it is guided not by the idea of charity but of &quot;horizontal solidarity,&quot; empowering people by providing a marketplace for truly valuable skills. In this case study, I&#39;ll focus on how my understanding of the business model and brand shaped the project plan, information architecture, and my visual design choices.</p>

<h6>Strategy</h6>

<p>Tripstigator serves three user types:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>consumers, who purchase products</p></li>
<li><p>mentors, who facilitate by helping locals post and access needed technology</p></li>
<li><p>locals, who provide products</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In line with Tripstigator&#39;s values, it was key that these users not be considered discrete - that a mentor could also be a consumer, and that a local could function as their own mentor. Creating an interface that allowed for a spectrum of uses for each user was key.</p>

<p>We also established fairly obvious KPIs: Donations, purchases, lead generation, mentor signups, and products. We knew that the only way to attract purchases was through quality product offerings, which required locals, who would be recruited by mentors. At the time, mentors were being actively recruited and trained by the team - the process was not designed for scale. Mapping out mentor onboarding from sign up to product posting was one of the first user flows I prioritized.</p>

    <div class="col-md-12 text-center">

    </div>
</div>

<p>The second priority was purchase flow. I had plenty of conventional frameworks to draw on for creating a slick user funnel, so reordering the flow to be as low friction as possible was straightforward.
Having given preliminary thought to the components of the MVP, I started to tie the pieces together with a project plan. I went through the original sitemap, and listed and organized the pages that would be navigation targets in the header and footer. I then prioritized pages and flows based on strategy discussions with the founder and a business consultant. We came to agree that our brand should be more focused on providing a great customer experience than on the philanthropic nature of the platform.</p>

<h6>Information Architecture</h6>

    <div class="col-md-8 col-md-push-2">
        <img src="/img/portfolio/Tripstigator-IA.png">
        <p class="text-center"><i>Draft of IA with comments</i></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>The most complicated of the dashboards was the mentor dashboard: mentors can add locals to platform, post products, access internal resources, and still access all purchasing functionality. Locals and consumers use basically a subset of the mentor dashboard. Since everyone has access to purchasing and typically carts are located in the top right, I added purchasing under &quot;My Account&quot;- the tab that opens when a user signs in. The other user-specific pages were added to the left of the dashboard.
Dropdown menus are typically a no-no, for good reason. The rational for using one here was to focus the user&#39;s attention on shopping, leaving &quot;Get Involved&quot; as a more abstract idea. While this isn&#39;t the best way to get donations, it clarifies what the typical user&#39;s next step is.
Finally, I listed and grouped the additional pages for the footer, always a useful exercise for understanding the full scope of the site. </p>

<h6>Results</h6>

<p>This process led to a landing page designed to express Tripstigator&#39;s identity and funnel users to conversion points.

I then mocked up the purchase flow, mentor onboarding flow, and other key pages, all the while solidifying a consistent UI strategy and mobile versions for pages with complicated layouts.</p>

<p>When the priority items had been accomplished and I was preparing to move on to my next project, I created a UI reference for the developer so the platform could maintain a consistent visual style as it evolved.</p>

<h6>Summary</h6>

<p>This project was an opportunity to create and execute a brand vision fairly autonomously. While it was exciting to have so much creative direction, it also pushed me to be extra critical of my own work. It was a great learning experience to plan and execute this project.
The website is still in development, but you can see some of the initial pages up on the <a href="https://www.tripstigator.com">Tripstigator site</a>.</p>
