Hi, I'm Abbey. I'm beginning my third year at UC Berkeley this fall, studying Operations Research and Management Science. If you haven't heard of it, you're not alone- it's sort of a combination of statistics, computer science, and economics.  

This summer, I'm interning at Branch Metrics, a deeplinking startup in Palo Alto. My role is somewhere between designer and product manager - my main project for the summer is redesigning the website, from copy to wireframes to development.

I'm currently considering internships for Summer 2016. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:abigailchaver@berkeley.com) if you have an exciting project.
