Hey, I'm Abbey. I study Operations Research and Management Science at UC Berkeley. Operations Research draws on many different fields, including statistics, computer science, and economics. It's a rigorous technical education, but I think of it as a critical foundation for doing creative as well as analytical work. Right now, I'm particularly interested in UX and the role that data plays in building better interfaces.


I'm in school, but always excited to learn outside of the classroom. Feel free to [contact me](abbey.chaver@gmail.com).
