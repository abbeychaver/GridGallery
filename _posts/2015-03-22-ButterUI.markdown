### Dashboard Design

A brand new startup building out their minimum viable product, Butter needed an easy to use dashboard. After researching their product, I designed a more obvious interface with a warm, clean aesthetic. 

Becuase landlords need to be confident that the dashboard won't allow them to miss a task, I made it clear where the user needed to respond to an item, and where they could passively view or interact with information. I simplified the information structure of the dashboard, and suggested features I considered missing.

To make these suggestions easy to digest, I did a high fidelity mockup to convey the brand look, and then presented a version with usability comments and suggestions.
