# Optimizing Wage Contracts for Last-Mile Delivery
### 2nd place in a logistics optimization competition

###### Summary

This was a short-term (around one week) open-ended project to design an optimal wage policy for different types of shipping contracts. We developed a model based on game theory and to determine the optimal wages to offer in order to minimize costs and undelivered packages. After discussing our model in front of a panel of Amazon logistics researchers, our six page white paper was awarded second place.

###### Models and Tools

Our model was built in R, with optimum values determined through graph search.

[Here's](abbeychaver.github.io/img/portfolio/Amazon_Collider_Project.pdf) the six page paper, with a code appendix.
