# Amazon Collider Competition

###Goal
Amazon Logistics opened a competition to UC Berkeley's Industrial Engineering department. The challenge was to write a white paper solving an open-ended logistics problem:
There is a daily distribution of packages to deliver. Three types of delivery drivers can fulfill this demand: guaranteed drivers, who must be paid whether or not there are packages to deliver; option drivers, who are paid a reservation price to be available but may be sent home if there are no packages for them; and spot drivers, who are only paid if there are packages left. Determine the wage each type of driver should be offered.

###What I Did
- Establish scope of our model to ensure project completion
- Defined game theory framework for solving the model
- Defined variables, parameters, and relating equations
- Wrote white paper to explain the model


###Result
Our submission was selected for in-person review and won second place. The paper is 6 pages plus a code appendix in R - take a look.
