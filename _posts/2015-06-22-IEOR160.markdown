# Project Scheduling Optimization

###Goal
This project was completed for an Operations Research class focusing on determinisic optimization. The problem was to maximize profit for a company that could invest in twelve projects over a period of three years. Given parameters about these projects' costs, revenue, duration, and assorted production constraintsm, determine an optimal schedule.

###What I Did
- Defined decision variables and parameters
- Defined logical constraints as linear inequalities
- Coded the model in AMPL (a linear programming language) in order to solve

###Result
The paper detailing our model and solutions for the four variations of the problem is about 15 pages- you can read my code at the end.
