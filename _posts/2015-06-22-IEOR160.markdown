### Project Scheduling Optimization

This project was completed for an Operations Research class focusing on determinisic optimization. The problem was to maximize profit for a company that could invest in twelve projects over a period of three years. Given parameters about these projects' costs, revenue, duration, and assorted production constraints, we translated the problem into a linear program that we then solved with AMPL.
