### Jekyll Photography Portfolio

This was fun project to encourage my sister in her creative endeavors. Based on a "Freelancer" Jekyll theme, I wanted this kid-friendly site to look cute but not cutesy. The one-page layout is responsive and super-navigable. The landing page features a portrait I created in Adobe Illustrator of my favorite eleven-year-old.
