# Zeeva's Lens

###Goal
To get familiar with Jekyll, a framework that generates static. blog-aware sites (this site is built on it too), I made my little sister a kid-friendly website to display her creative work.

###What I Did
- Created a hero portrait with Adobe Illustrator
- Customized a template with HTML and CSS
- Hosted the site with Github Pages

###Result
See it [here.] (http://zeevachaver.github.io)
