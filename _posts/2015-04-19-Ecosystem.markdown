# The Deep Link Ecosystem

###Goal
Deep Linking has been getting a lot of press lately, with huge player releasing their own solutions. My goal in this ecosystem was to educate developers about the differences between the solutions available. By showing how fragmented the market is, I wanted to communicate that universal solutions like ours are the most useful to a developer.

###What I Did
- Wrote the content
- Designed the visuals in Adobe Illustrator
