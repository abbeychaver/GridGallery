#Website Redesign - In Progress

###Goal
We need to improve navigability, message strategy, and visual aesthetic. Our goal is to increase high quality, converting signups on the site.

###What I'm Doing:
- A/B testing and user profiling for messaging stratefy
- Internal Data analysis to identify high value signups and most popular features
- Navigation design based on user flow data from Google Analytics
- Partner surveying to determine most important technical features and perceived brand identity
- Organizing content to support optimal flow for target market
- Identifying and building missing content
- Wireframing

This project is still in the works, but it should be done by September. Check back then.
