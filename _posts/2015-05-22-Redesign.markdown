### Website Redesign - in progress

During my second summer at Branch Metrics, I'm leading the redesign of the website. My team's goal is to  improve signup rates and increase long-tail integrations of our SDK. 

I'm using partner surveys, demographic data, conversion rates from different channels, and website user flow data to understand our stickiest material. Using an agile approach, we are using A/B testing to validate new messaging and visual strategies.

We are also improving the information architecture of the site and designing user flows for our most important personas. We are in early stages, but intend to complete the visual design by the beginning of August and complete development before September.
