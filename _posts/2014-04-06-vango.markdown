caption: A study on how our links drove growth for one of our first partners

Branch Metrics is a deeplinking company. For most people, that description doesn't mean very much - even for our target market of developers, deeplinking is not a universally understood feature. My goal in writing and designing this case study was to communicate how our linking product could solve a common problem for mobile apps: cross-platform content sharing. 

While our partner Vango used Branch links for several different growth strategies, including a referral program, I decided to focus on content-sharing functionality to present a simpler narrative arc. This case study clearly presents one of the ways Branch links provide value for app developers.
