description: APT Case Competition on Time Series Data
title: Hypothesis Testing on Sales
---

## Summary

Applied Predictive Technologies' software helps businesses run internal experiments on offline data like in-store purchases. In this case competition, a client was interested in determining the effect of several varieties of poster campaign on profits. We used hypothesis testing on several months of sales data from a test and control group to determine whether various iterations of a sales campaign had a positive effect on profits. Our presentation won third place.

## Project Outline

- Identify possible confounding variables available in data set

- Verify that treatment group and control group have similar distributions of possible confounding variables

- Plot and compare profits by product across treatment and control groups

- Choose best statistic for hypothesis test: percent mean difference for each store over weeks before and weeks after campaign.

- Run t-tests on each campaign

- Check correlations between test statistic and possible confounding variables

- Analyze relationship between sales of different products to determine overall effect on products

- Provide recommendation for continuing poster campaign

## Tools

For modeling and plotting, we used R and Python, including Pandas for some data manipulation and standardization.
