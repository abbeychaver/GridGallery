#Tripstigator Website Design



<div class-"col-xs-12 col-md-5"> </div>

###Goal
Tripstigator wanted to redesign their site to look less like a social enterprise and more consumer-focused, on a deadline

###What I did
- Defined a project plan for completing the redesign in under two months
- Devloped strategy with the founder and a business consultant to meet brand goals and KPIs
- Defined the information architecture of the site and internal dashboards
- Defined key user flows to increase conversions
- Developed new aesthetic and defined UI elements
- Designed about 20 key pages


###Results



<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-7">
