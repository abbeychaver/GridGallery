# Branch Metrics Visual Brand Guide

###Goal
We at Branch needed a reference document summarizing our aesthetic to support the design of our marketing and sales materials and our website and dashboard interfaces.

###What I Did
- Defined logo practices, font use, and imagery guidelines
- Built out a full color palette
- Standardized visual interface elements such as buttons and menus to improve clarity and UX
