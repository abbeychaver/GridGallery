### Branch Metrics Visual Brand Guide

Developing a brand identity is a critical step for a start-up to cultivate a loyal user base. As we got a better sense of the profile we were targeting - mobile app developers - we were able to make our message more consistent. Part of that was defining our visual identity: summarizing the way we look. 

I compiled a reference for critical brand essentials like logo, palette, font, and more. The project was a great opportunity to reflect on the brand we've built so far and where we plan to take it.
