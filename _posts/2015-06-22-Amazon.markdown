### Amazon Logistics White Paper

Amazon Logistics opened a competition to UC Berkeley's Industrial Engineering department. The challenge was to write a 6-page white paper solving an open-ended logistics problem:


There is a daily distribution of packages to deliver. Three types of delivery drivers can fulfill this demand: guaranteed drivers, who must be paid whether or not there are packages to deliver; option drivers, who are paid a reservation price to be available but may be sent home if there are no packages for them; and spot drivers, who are only paid if there are packages left. Determine the wage each type of driver should be offered.

Using game theory and nonlinear optimization, we built a model that minimized Amazon's cost as a function of drivers' risk aversion coefficient, the probability of getting hired on the open market, and the market wage. We then built the model in R to verify that its solution provided reasonable numbers and could be modified with empirical numbers to provide a legitimate solution.

Our submission was selected for in-person review and won second place.
