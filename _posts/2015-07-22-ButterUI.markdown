#Dashboard Design



<div class-"col-xs-12 col-md-5"> </div>

###Goal
Butter needed to design their MVP, a dashboard for landlords to manage their properties with Butter's service.

###What I did
- Categorized Butter's landlord services and content to make navigation intuitive
- Profiled the landlord user to build the product around their needs
- Organized content by user priority to make their flow through the dashboard natural
- Suggested feature to let users keep more management information on Butter
- Propose feed layout to maximize engagement and monetization opportunities
- Place call to actions at points where conversions are most likely
- Lay out page to be familiar and easy to use for less tech-savvy users
- Cultivated a clean, organized aesthetic.


###Results



<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-7">
